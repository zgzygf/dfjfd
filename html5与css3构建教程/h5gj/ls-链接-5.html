				 <h2 id="question-01">Can an id have more than word?</h2>
				 <p>Yes, your ids can have more than one word as long as there are no spaces. Separate each word
				➝ with a dash instead.</p>
				 <h2 id="question-02">Can visitors bookmark anchor links?</h2>
				 <p>Yes, they can! And when they visit that link, the browser will jump down to the anchor as
				➝ expected. Visitors can share the link with others, too, so all the more reason to choose
				➝ meaningful anchor names.</p>
				 <h2 id="question-03">My anchor link isn't working. What am I doing wrong?</h2>
				 <p>The problem could be a few things. First, double-check that you added an id (without "#") to
				➝ the element your link should point to. Also, be sure that the anchor in your link <em>is</em>
				➝ preceded by "#" and that it matches the anchor id.</p>
